A Gas flow rate via choke size prediction of bangladeshi oil-gas well using machine learning regressors
Most oil and gas production facilities use a device known as a choke to control the flow of fluids produced from wells. Typically, equipment such as the line heaters and wellsite separators contain a choke. Gas flow rate via Choke size prediction is a open problem in petrolium and mining. his study shows that there is a strict quantitative connection between three factors: upstream pressure, gas-oil ratio and choke size with oil flow rate at critical flow for one hundred production tests of bangladeshi gas/oil wells. Result shows that pressure U/S is inversely correlated to average choke  size with value of -0.51%. We have also calculated GLR from gas rate, condensed rate and water rate. The ML regression models result are compared and RF model shows that it can predict choke size with MAE of .142919, RMSE of 0.952750 R2 square value of 0.993937.
